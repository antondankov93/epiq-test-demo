   style: code changes that do not affect its meaning (formatting, adding semicolons, etc.)
   refactor: code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
   perf: code changes that improve performance
   test: adding new tests or correcting existing ones
   chore: other changes that do not affect the code
```
```
<scope> – specifies the place or functionality affected by the commit (file name, scope of changes, etc.)
```
```
<subject> – the content of the message, "What exactly was done?"
```
